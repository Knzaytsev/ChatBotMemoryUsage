Do you like pop, or what genres of music do you enjoy most?"},{"author":"bot_1","text":"I like some pop music. As a matter of fact, I actually enjoy Lady Gaga. But I'm more of a hard rock or industrial music guy. Since you walk on the beach, do you live on the coast?"},{"author":"bot_0","text":"I wish! I live in the city but I grew up in California. I get homesick a lot but I still take walks on the beach every single chance I get. In fact, I'm taking a vacation to Thailand next month and will be going to the beaches there. Have you ever been?"},{"author":"bot_1","text":"I've never been anywhere outside of the US, besides going to Canada once as a kid. I'd love to do more travel. Thailand looks so beautiful, so I'm rather envious. Is it going to be your first trip there?"},{"author":"bot_0","text":"I have been once before and fell in love. I told myself I'd go back to visit the beaches since I only got a chance to go to Bangkok when I went the first time. You should definitely try to travel more, there is so much to discover!"},{"author":"bot_1","text":"I agree, but I haven't been in a financial position to do much of that. Thankfully, my wife got an amazing job, and so our situation's improving enough for us to start planning some international travel next year. We're thinking of going to Japan."},{"author":"bot_0","text":"Nice! Thailand was very, very cheap. My flight cost less than a thousand dollars round trip and I spent less than a thousand dollars while I was there and I was there for two weeks. Japan I hear is very expensive, though. I'm glad your financial situation is improving! Hopefully you get to travel a lot in a few years!"},{"author":"bot_1","text":"Thank you! Yes, Japan is pretty expensive, but we both have been wanting to visit the Disney theme park over there, because it looks so amazing. So are you doing anything else besides laying on the beach when you visit Thailand?"},{"author":"bot_0","text":"I will be going to Chiang Mai to stay at an elephant sanctuary for about a week where I will be doing charity work. I will also visit a few temples in Chiang Rai. Disney sounds like fun. I used to go to Disney a lot as a kid since I grew up near the park in California."},{"author":"bot_1","text":"My wife and I live in Orlando, and have a bunch of friends working at the parks, so it's become a big part of our lives. That's so neat that you're doing elephant sanctuary work; I did a day of volunteering at one a couple years ago."}],"summary":" 1.

I feel like my work background isn't too relevant, and not having any management experience yet doesn't help. Still, it's a worth a shot."},{"author":"bot_0","text":"That's true. Hadn't considered that. Would your spouse be willing to move if need be as well?"},{"author":"bot_1","text":"Hopefully that won't have to happen; it's not something we've discussed yet. I'm not to keen on it myself, with Disneyworld and my parents so closeby. I might just have to stay on as a sales rep for a little while longer if things don't pan out."}],"summary":" 1.
