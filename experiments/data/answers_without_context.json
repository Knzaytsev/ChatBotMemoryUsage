It's gonna be tough if such happens.\nHuman: I'd imagine you have a harness for him in that case. I've always thought about getting those for pets.\nAssistant: That's a good idea. I guess you need to give him plenty of play time with them.If you have a friend with you, you can ask them to take a picture of you doing it to compare.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Did you play with your cat?\nAssistant: Yes i did, we went for a walk.\nHuman: A walk?

That's for sure. I hope the store nearby has them.\nAssistant: There's a pet shop nearby. I can check there on my way home.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Did you play with your cat?\nAssistant: Yes i did, we went for a walk.\nHuman: A walk? Where did you go?

The black and white look perfect.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I finally visited the pet store and bought nice harnesses for all my pets.\nAssistant: Great! What is your favorite type of harness to use on your pets?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I finally visited the pet store and bought nice harnesses for all my pets.\nAssistant: That's good, I'm glad you got that sorted. It will be good for them. Remind me what pets you have.\nHuman: I have 2 dogs and a cat.  So now they're all ready to go for a walk.  Surprisingly, my cat actually walks with us sometimes.  Does your cat ever go outside?\nAssistant: He usually goes outside for a walk but lately he's been complaining of a stomachache and complaining he can't poop outside. I tried taking him to the vet but he said he's not allowed to go yet. I'm guessing his medicine isn't doing anything.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I finally visited the pet store and bought nice harnesses for all my pets.\nAssistant: That's good, I'm glad you got that sorted.

Does your cat ever go outside?\nAssistant: Yeah, sometimes. We have a bit of land around our house so she goes prowling. Sometimes brings us some presents back.\nHuman: Yuck, those cat presents are never fun.  I've gotten my fair share of those, haha!  What's your cat's name?\nAssistant: Milly. She's a female and she's the only cat I've got right now. She's the sweetest.

How do the cat and the dogs get on?\nHuman: Aww, that's a cute name.  They really do quite well together.  They're all like best buds.  They're really protective of each other though, so they're not always quick to warm up to other peoples pets.\nAssistant: That sounds lovely. I love dogs so much. I hope one day I get a dog.Why are your friends so good at making friends?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I finally visited the pet store and bought nice harnesses for all my pets.\nAssistant: That's good, I'm glad you got that sorted.

That shows you must be taking real good care of them for them to be comfortable together. How is your work going?\nHuman: It's going.  I don't know, it's fine I guess.  It gets monotonous cleaning gutters all day, but at least I can listen to music while I work. How about you? How's your job going lately?\nAssistant: What about you? How do you feel about your job? Does it give you joy and fulfillment?\n"]
