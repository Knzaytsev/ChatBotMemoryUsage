Did you ever pop in like you said you needed to?\nAssistant: Things are going great. Thanks for asking. No, I havn't gotten the chance to pop in yet. Hopefully this week. Have you started any new writing projects since we last spoke?\nHuman: I've been tossing around a few ideas in my head this week.  Nothing firm yet, maybe I need some more liquid inspiration.\nAssistant: Ha, ha! Do you find you write better when you drink? When I drink I get very sleepy. No inspiration whatsoever\nHuman: I feel that I can relax a bit more when I just have a drink or two.  Anything more and I find I can't focus like I should.  Do you sell alcohol in your store?\nAssistant: I completely understand. Well, whatever gets your creative juices flowing. I used to sell alcohol in my store but I think my wife is slowly converting my store into a specialty store... vegan, organic. Business seems to still be going well, so I do not interfere\nHuman: That sounds like a good way to go, people are becoming more health conscious nowadays.  I feel like I should try going on a vegan diet but it's really  hard to give up meat.  \nAssistant: It definitely is but you have to remember what they say. \"Meat is the ultimate candy for some people.\"\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I found a great new book that I think you would like to read. \nAssistant: Really? What book is it? I have been trying to find a new good book.\nHuman: I guess I shouldn't call it new since it's been out for a few years, but I only recently heard of it. It's called Defending Jacob. Have you read that one yet?\nAssistant: No I have not. What is it about? It sounds pretty interesting. Is it crime related?\nHuman: Yes, it's crime related, but it also explores family dynamics. A teenage boy (Jacob) is accused of killing a classmate, and Jacob's father is a prosecutor.\nAssistant: I am already sold. That sounds really interesting. I will have to check it out. Have you read the whole book? Also, are you still looking for a financial advisor? My schedule opened up so I can help you with anything you need next week.\nHuman: I haven't read it yet. I heard of it becausse YouTube turned it into a mini-series. I have to admit I watched the show before reading the book! Haha! Yes, I'm still in the market for a financial advisor. It's time to start thinking about retirement.\nAssistant: Oh okay. Well I will check it out since I rather read the book first. And that is good to hear, how about you stop by my office next week and we can go over your plans for retirement. \nHuman: I think I can fit that into my schedule. Early afternoons are best for me. I'm not sure I really have retirement plans yet. I just know that I want to retire one day!\nAssistant: It will be good to get a plan together. You are not that far away from retirement. Maybe you should start thinking about what you really want to retire to. I bet you wish to travel.

Some government officials are discussing tuition regulation, the article may interest you.\nAssistant: Oh! I would love to read that. Can you give me a summary of what the article mentioned?\nHuman: It basically stated that high tuition is making it harder for some students to obtain a degree which could damage many industries in the future! I'm hopeful something is done, but you know how lax the government can be when it comes to that type of stuff.\nAssistant: Yes, i totally agree. It is a very important issue to be resolved. Well, i am hoping that the officials do take action soon. How about you, where do you study?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How are you and your cats doing today over in Alaska?\nAssistant: Good thanks.

He has the adventure genre on lock down I think. Do you like the rock?\nHuman: Yeah they're a fun watch. You're totally right, the Rock has been in everything recently I feel like. \nAssistant: Yeah man I think he is a hard worker, I think he is a good role model. Plus he loves his jeep! So he is good in my books!\nHuman: haha yeah, gotta love a good Jeep. So reliable and so much you can do to them. I just got bigger tires on mine!\nAssistant: Yeah, I am a big jeep enthusiast. I know you do not like any of the Jeep parts.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I practiced my singing some more for my talent show appearance.\nAssistant: Wow, that sounds nice! Have you performed in any competitions before? What's your favorite song to sing?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I've been watching quite a bit of movies with my spare time.\nAssistant: I had just an hour to go hiking this weekend.\nHuman: I went for a long hike yesterday afternoon! Do you have a dream hiking destination?\nAssistant: I think that the Grand Canyon would be nice hiking on.\nHuman: I've gone for a round trip hike there to the bottom of the canyon and back. I reached the rim on my ascent just as the sun was going up, it was breathtaking.\nAssistant: I'm a bit of introvert. We may not be the best friends of all time.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How was your shift at the hospital?\nAssistant: It's always so busy and crazy but I love my job.

What songs do you like to sing?\nHuman: I can sing folk songs the best for some reason. And get this, I am going to audition for a show with ponies! I wonder how ponies sing :)\nAssistant: A show with ponies?!  What do the ponies do in the show?  And I bet ponies sing by snorting, haha!\nHuman: Hey you may be right! haha The ponies are only in the background, domestic ponies of course. But how cool is that. Maybe you could draw some of them if you come to the show.\nAssistant: That sounds like so much fun!  And yes, I would like to come to the show and I will bring my drawing notebook with me.  The show is Friday, right?  What time?\nHuman: The show runs Friday and Saturday. I will have to check but I think it starts at 5:00 pm each night. So are your braces still bothering you?\nAssistant: I'll see if my mom can take me Friday.  Can't wait!  My braces mostly hurt after the orthodontist tightens them.  At least I can pick out a different color each time.\nHuman: I feel for you! But I can't wait to see you when the braces finally come off, you will look great! What's the next color you're going to pick? I vote for light blue.\nAssistant: Thanks! ", "Dialog:\nHuman: I forgot to mention last time that many stationary bikes include holders for books and/or phones, which would make it easy for you to read while working out. I might suggest that you tell the staff of their gym to look into these, since the gym doesn't seem to have any now.\nAssistant: That sounds perfect! Wouldn't it be great to have some time to read while exercising?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I took a walk with Fifi Von Trixibelle and made sure she didn't damage her nails.\nAssistant: It's funny Bruce, especially after the accident, has no issues getting his nails done, but little Elle is a real stinker with it!\nHuman: In many respects, dogs are lucky to have the symbiotic relationship they have with humans. They get free food and can live like kings.\nAssistant: Yeah, it's like they are actually family!\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: What did you do in the army and what was it like?\nAssistant: I was in a tank division. It was very stressful but I got good experience and knowledge from there, also it strengthen my mind and body. Have you been in military?\nHuman: Military life is not for me but I did consider it briefly. Would have been cool have have college paid for and everything. Tank division sounds real tough! How's the bf?\nAssistant: He is doing great, just recently started new job as game tester. Yes military as a job is not for everybody. Can you tell me more about open relationships and how it exactly works?\nHuman: You know I guess it's just really whatever works for you and your partner. With Heb and I, basically we communicate our expectations and have the freedom to do whatever we want with other individuals. As long as we are honest and open about our set boundaries and stuff. Have you ever considered it?\nAssistant: Well I am for more traditional relationship but thanks for explanation. If it works for you I am happy for you both. Are you considering to have kids later on?\nHuman: Ehhhh maybe, I'm not sure. I like my freedom (and my money haha). How about you?\nAssistant: Our plan for now is to buy a house and then full attention on getting pregnant. I want little sweet kid which is my blood you know.

I'm excited for you with the house. Where will you buy\nAssistant: Yes I agree with you that's why we are working hard to save money. Would like to buy somewhere outside of city centre where is quite and safe. Do you have your own property?\nHuman: Oh yeah we've had our house for three years now.

I heard the venues in your area have great food and drink. \nHuman: No I haven't got my pizza yet. The ribs at this bbq place are really good here too.\nAssistant: Oh man, I haven't had ribs in such a long time. Those sound like they'd hit the spot right about now. Do you have the weekend off from work? Since I sell stuff from home my days tend to blend together lol.\nHuman: Yes, those ribs really are great. My job is very stressful sometimes I wish I worked from home.\nAssistant: What's the most stressful part of it so far? I used to really like working from home, but I get too distracted with my guitar sometimes. It's hard to concentrate when it's staring at me all day lol. \nHuman: The truckers can be rude mostly. A guitar is a good distraction to have.\nAssistant: Oh my God, I completely forgot they can be so rude. Sometimes there are times where I don't want to go to work anymore.

There is a series on there called day breakers that's really good. Are you keeping all 3 jobs after the wedding?\nAssistant: I will definitely check it out. I'll be dropping one job, as I believe I will be getting a promotion.\nHuman: Oh that is awesome. I've been thinking about changing jobs.\nAssistant: Switching sometimes helps with getting better pay. Will it still be in the fast food industry, or elsewhere?\nHuman: Maybe something in a BBQ joint. Then I'll always smell a lot better than mcdonalds.\nAssistant: A definite plus! I've been getting into cooking a lot lately, BBQ is one of the things I like.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How is the living arrangements with her grandparents. \nAssistant: It can be very challenging at times but I wouldn't have it any other way.

I've never heard of a church hosting a car show. I'd love to come check it out. maybe I can bring the chevy once it's finished. I'll definitely send you some pictures. \nHuman: Yes, it is a local hot rod club that has partnered with the church and uses the big front parking lot. We have food booths and its a way to raise money for the church. I volunteer my time and I think you would fit right in with the group of people who attend.  \nAssistant: thanks for letting me know. when is the next one? I'd like to make sure I keep my schedule clear so I can go.\nHuman: I will get the details and send it to you. I also have a new group of people who are getting together once a week to do yoga in the park. Does that sound fun to you?\nAssistant: no, not really. I never really got into yoga.

We could repaint.  Hang up some pictures.  Decorate a bit.  Rearrange your furniture to make thing flow more easily.  What do you think?  Where do you want to start?\nAssistant: We would have to start upstairs to clear some room out. I'm just not sure where I would want things or what to get rid of. I like the sound of your plan we just might need to think about it as we go along.\nHuman: That's a good idea!  I don't want to pressure you into anything.  Have you heard of Marie Kondo?  You can do the thing were you touch each of your items and see if they mean something to you still or if you're ready to get rid of them.  It really helps to just pick up each item and see if you want to get rid of it!\nAssistant: I have not heard of them, I just have so much trouble parting with some things. The concept sounds interesting but nerve-wracking!\nHuman: LOL!  Yes, it does take some time but it's supposedly helped a lot of people!  It's hard to get rid of things with memories attached to them!  We could also find a way to display some of your treasures! \nAssistant: I'm not sure about this, I guess I'm just old fashioned but I worry about putting memories on display. They should be stored away or treasured in silence.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I just took the dogs for a walk at a great dog park! \nAssistant: That sounds like fun!

The weather isn't always friendly down here in Antarctica!\nHuman: I was thinking about you the other day when it got below zero here. I don't know how you do it!\nAssistant: Yeah, my research keeps me here but I hate the weather. It's pretty cold in Maine this time of year though. You're probably pretty tough to withstand that New England winter.\nHuman: I'm tough! If you think tough is turning up the heat, wearing two pairs of socks and never going outside in the winter.\nAssistant: I've always wanted to visit Maine. I should come up and have a lobster roll.

When you come up, we'll have a real New England clam bake. Lobster, steamers, corn on the cob...everything!\nAssistant: That sounds incredible. Just don't make it too spicy. Are there any great spots for photography up there?\nHuman: Of course! Would you like to take some pictures of moose and bears? \nAssistant: No! That's what I hate in Maine. I go for the outdoor, natural things, not for killing animals. I could probably take some pictures of the ocean you'll have a great lobster roll\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How is Sleuth doing?

I prefer better to listen audio books instead. I even have Amazon's audible subscription. Maybe you want to try audio books as well?\nHuman: I've used audio books in the past but nothing beats holding good old fashioned paper in your hands, I love the smell of a brand new book, you know?\nAssistant: I can understand that, but reading books is not possible when you're a truck driver. You have to spend many hours on the road. Audio books are the best option for you.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How is Sleuth doing? I know you said he was getting on in years.\nAssistant: Surprisingly well.

Great spots for hiking. Do you have good places to hike around school?\nHuman: Yeah there's a lot of great hiking spots around here. I usually try to go at least once a week. I joined a hiking club at my college, which has been a great way to connect with people with similar interests. Do you ever go camping?\nAssistant: Sometimes I do like to go camping. Occasionally I've gone solo camping... that's quite an experience. Have you ever done that?\nHuman: Once or twice. I didn't really enjoy it much. I like solo hiking, but for camping I prefer to be out with a group of friends and have someone else to talk to. \nAssistant: Yeah, I can see that. To me, camping is great because it's like an escape from all the noise of the city. I feel like the wilderness has a way of centering me and clearing my head. Do you ever go fishing?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: You'll never believe this, I just sold car insurance to this guy who doesn't have a car! \nAssistant: That's funny you can still sell car insurance if he doesn't have a car.

I think I'll start booking it tonight!\nAssistant: Were you able to find some reasonable rates on everything?\nHuman: Really reasonable! I got such a good last minute deal i couldn't turn it down. i'm so excited to visit the beach and relax a little. \nAssistant: It's always hard to find deals for the last minute. Have you ever tried booking a vacation house?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I have managed to go a whole day with out smoking.\nAssistant: Hey, that's great - well done you! How are you feeling for it?\nHuman: Hmm a little bit frustrated and nervous but at least I am making some progress. What do you study?\nAssistant: Just finished up on dentistry, so I'm trying to find a job in that field. If you ever need teeth whitening to counter the coffee and cigarettes, I can do you a deal!\nHuman: Thank you very much, that would be great! I guess you could also give me advice on healthy food ha ha\nAssistant: Probably not pizza, as much as I love it! Right now, I'm really big on falafel as a health food. You ever had that?\nHuman: I have never had that, is it good? I might give it a try. Where do you usually buy it, any recommendations?\nAssistant: It's great! Very tasty - you can add spices to it and really customise the flavour. It's filling and keeps your digestion going. Falafel on pizza too is grand. You know that little health store two blocks away?\nHuman: It sounds amazing when you describe it, it is making my shopping list for sure. Yes, I think I know which one but if I can't find it I will give you a call\nAssistant: Most definitely! You got any trips planned this year? I know you like the cooler weather!\nHuman: Actually yes, every dollar I save from not smoking is a dollar more for the trip to Alaska. My plan is to go on a cruise and just relax for a week\nAssistant: That's a nice one! What's your trip going to be like?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: So the halibut meal was a hit! My ex told me he loved it and missed my cooking. Maybe we still have a chance here?\nAssistant: Glad you enjoyed the halibut, I love it.  Maybe there is still a change with you ex, the question is, do you still have male friends? Has the situation changed at all or is it going to end up same?\nHuman: I do still have a lot of male friends, and I love my friends very much. I am not willing to give them up. My ex and I have not re-visited that issue. I hope he realizes he's being silly about it.\nAssistant: I am not sure about that, how is the situation with his daughter? Is she not willing to accept you because you are male? Maybe the situation will change, maybe not. I hope you know what is best for you, you need to take care of you\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How often do you go hunting? And what would you say is your biggest achievement in hunting?\nAssistant: Probably allowing me to feed my family well for the whole season. Do you hunt? \nHuman: That actually does sound amazing to be able to feed your family directly from your own efforts. I don't hunt. I'm usually too busy taking pictures of the animals, haha.\nAssistant: That's cool too, do you sell your photography at all? \nHuman: I do! Even though I'm an editor, because management knows I take photos and like my work, they sometimes ask me to take photos for features. Usually, though, I sell my work to nature magazines and blogs.\nAssistant: What nature magazines have you been in?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Did you play with your cat?\nAssistant: Yes i did, we went for a walk.\nHuman: A walk? Where did you go? Does he stay calm outside?\nAssistant: We went to the park. yes a bit calm but not always.\nHuman: That's so funny, what would you do if he climbed up a tree?\nAssistant: I wouldn't want to be that careless. It's gonna be tough if such happens.\nHuman: I'd imagine you have a harness for him in that case. I've always thought about getting those for pets.\nAssistant: Yes that's the best, you should get one you know. It'd be great.\nHuman: I'd feel a lot better using that rather than a collar! That's for sure. I hope the store nearby has them.\nAssistant: I'd imagine there's a pet store around you.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: You'll never believe this, I just sold car insurance to this guy who doesn't have a car! \nAssistant: wow! you must be the best insurance salesman ever.

I get to meet a lot of interesting people. Sometimes i have to chauffeur celebrities!\nHuman: That would be something I would love to do. Who have you met that is famous?\nAssistant: Ive driven for Jay-Z and Kanye West. I also chauffeured a woman who was the singer from some pop-group you may have heard before!\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I'm feeling inspired to write my next project about my journey to trying out veganism.\nAssistant: Well what do you say come by my store and pick up some fresh produce? We carry vegan meats too.\nHuman: I definitely will! I think it will be challenging for me to stop eating meat, so it will be good to have substitutes. I especially enjoy hamburgers, so I hope you have a vegan option for that!\nAssistant: You don't have to cut down meat right away. Maybe try both vegan food and meat and maybe you can slowly start cutting down on meat?\nHuman: That's a good idea. Like eating a hamburger with a salad and vegetables. My partner is actually the one who suggested I write about trying veganism. I hope other people will be interested in hearing about it too!\nAssistant: Yea you are a good writer so if you publish your experience with different diets I am sure people will pay attention. So how's yoru partner doing?\nHuman: He is doing well. He works as a trainer at the local gym, so he is very health-conscious. A lot of his clients are vegans, actually. I bet many of them shop at your store!\nAssistant: You know I lost some customers once we stopped selling alcoholic beverages. So I am not sure if your partners' clients shop at my store.\nHuman: That's okay, sometimes it is more important to make what you feel is the right personal choice, rather than the right business choice. How is your store doing?\nAssistant: Well it's doing good though the business isn't as it's supposed to be. I think people are not really interested in healthy food and that's the only problem with my business.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: My band signed up for the talent show at my college.\nAssistant: That sounds cool!

Who have you met that is famous?\nAssistant: oh just Katy Perry and Pat Monaham. No big deal. \nHuman: Did they just act like norman people or were they snobbish?\nAssistant: They were pretty nice but mostly kept to themselves. No one ever wants to spend too much time chatting with the help. I can't say that it was a bad experience.\nHuman: That is true. I bumped into  \nAssistant: oh yeah, the guy who loves playing golf. What about him? For the one with a passion for golfing\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: What kind of construction work do you do?\nAssistant: I build decks and remodel homes. What about you?

How has nursing been going lately for you?  Is it crazy and busy?\nAssistant: I'll send you some recipes today. Nursing has been crazy lately. I have no idea what's going on, but the head doctor of the practice thought it would be funny to schedule every patient he has for check up in the span of five days. It's crazy!\nHuman: Thank you!  Wow that is crazy!  Your days must go by so fast!  What else have you been up to lately?\nAssistant: Yea that is crazy. Honestly, I haven't been up to much else lately. I've been working overtime at the practice, so by the time I get home, I'm exhausted. I haven't even had the energy to tinker with my phones. What about you? What have you been up to?\nHuman: Hopefully things slow down for you soon so you have time to enjoy other things.  Lately I've been working on planning a vacation to Hawaii.  I can't wait to go and sit out on the beach all day!\nAssistant: Oh that sounds so relaxing! When are you planning to go?\nHuman: I'm still working on the exact dates depending on the pricing, but I'm thinking sometime in March.\nAssistant: Well, I think Hawaii is a great place to go. I've been there a couple of times, and it's so beautiful. When we went, we hiked up a volcano and it was crazy but so beautiful.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Why do you prefer summer over winter? I love the cooler weather.\nAssistant: I love going to the beach! It's one of my happy places. Nothing like sitting in the sand, music playing, beer in my hand, and looking at the ocean!\nHuman: Mmmmm that does sound so good. I bet you are hating it at the moment with this cold snap happening! Thank god I dont live in texas, my friends toilet froze today.\nAssistant: I've lived in Maryland my whole life so I'm used to both cold and heat! Right now it's snowing outside. I have friends in Texas. luckily they have been able to keep warm! Do how's it going with trying to quit smoking?\nHuman: So bad... I litreally cannot stop. I go for like 2 hours without a cig and I want to kill some one. Im thinking of taking a look at them tablets that change the brain so you dont smoke but Ive heard they can make you go a bit strange haha. Have you ever smoked?\nAssistant: Well, I hope you're able to quit eventually if you want to. I've heard it's very hard. My mother in law has been trying to quit forever. I've never smoked cigarettes, but I smoke cigars occasionally. \nHuman: It is so hard, probably the hardest addiction I have ever tried to kick. Even the thought of dieing doesnt put you off... they should have made it illegal when they found it instead of using it as a tax cash out. Strange though, I smoke but never tried a cigar. You dont inhale them do you.\nAssistant: I do. I love the taste of cigars!! I only smoke on special occasions though. I prefer to smoke the occasional cigar then smoke cigarettes all day. I can't imagine how much more addictive cigarette smoking is. You are here: Home > Government > Boards & Committees > Library Board of Trustees\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How was your shift at the hospital?\nAssistant: It was really exhausting, I'm glad it's over! I had a patient that was trying to argue with me about my diagnoses!\nHuman: That's too bad. Do you have any more shifts this week?\nAssistant: Just one more, thankfully. How is your sister doing? Is she just as busy?\nHuman: She is busy. It seems like she has had a lot of new patients lately. How's the bike riding going?\nAssistant: It's been great! It allows me to relieve some stress after a long shift. I like to bike by the water so I can watch the speedboats. Have you been jogging lately?\nHuman: I went a few weeks ago, but got shin splints, so I am resting for a bit. Are the trails by the water busy?\nAssistant: Oh, that's too bad. The trails can get busy during the day, which is why I try going early in the morning or at night. \nHuman: That would be fun. Are they well-lit? I would hate to run something over in the dark.\nAssistant: Yes actually! There's quite a few lampposts that illuminate the trails, and the moon reflects a lot of light off the water at night. It's really beautiful!\nHuman: That would be great. Are there people fishing along the trails? I would like to try that as well.\nAssistant: Yeah, you can find a lot of people fishing! Maybe bring your bike, so you can bike and fish at the same time!\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Have you drawn anything recently?\nAssistant: I just saw a really nice image from the new season of Attack on Titan and I started to draw it.

I remember when it used to take you much longer.\nAssistant: You know working on something that I like, push me to do it better and faster. Then I would say also that lately I improved a lot watching some tutorials on Youtube. I learned few new tricks. Have you ever watched any tutorial on Youtube? \nHuman: I've watched some occasionally when I needed to figure out how to do something, like change the oil in my car. It's useful to see someone else do it because I'm a visual learner.\nAssistant: I feel the same. Sometimes when I am not able to figure it out by myself, I just watch some videos where they make it look like so easy. It is incredible that you can find everything online, isn't it?\nHuman: Yes, what a time to be alive! Although sometimes I feel guilty that I have all the information in the world at my fingertips but I spend my free time watching movies LOL.\nAssistant: Procrastination is the new enemy of this era. What kind of movies do you like to watch in your spare time? \nHuman: I watch a lot of thrillers and horror movies. Most recently I watched one about the catacombs, very creepy.\nAssistant: I don't watch too many horror movies, I am such a baby that I get scared so easily. What else you usually do on free time?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How are things at your grocery store? Did you ever pop in like you said you needed to?\nAssistant: Things are going great.

I'll give you some inspiration by proxy.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: My favorite style is anything gold. Do you have a favorite style?\nAssistant: I just like simple styles.  What do you usually draw?\nHuman: I mainly use a style of realism, opting to draw beautiful, intricate landscapes and portraits of others. I'm hoping to sell some of my drawings and paintings soon to supplement my income.\nAssistant: That sounds very cool!  You can use that supplemental income to buy all the pizzas and earrings you want.\nHuman: Hahaha yes that is true. I can only eat so many pizzas, though, but my appetite for earrings and fashion is insatiable!\nAssistant: Tell me more about your cat friend please.\nHuman: Thanks for asking! I love talking about my cat! Her name is Liz and she is adorable! She loves snuggling with me on the couch while we watch movies together. How is your dog, Sleuth, doing?\nAssistant: He's getting old in age and not moving around so much anymore.  Did ever I tell you how he got his name?\nHuman: How old is he? No, but please tell me how you got his name.\nAssistant: He's 15 now.  I adopted Sleuth from the shelter when he was 10, and the shelter told me that he used to be a drug sniffing dog.  So I thought the name would fit perfectly.\nHuman: Wow, so that makes him about 105 years old in human years. That's a cool background story. Do you have any other dogs or just him?\nAssistant: ", "Dialog:\nHuman: I had a barbecue with my spouse today.\nAssistant: Oh nice! How did that go for you?\nHuman: We threw some ribs on the grills, as well as steaks and sausages.

I intend to return. what countries did you visit during your yacht trip? \nAssistant: I went all around the Mediterranean! Beautiful people there, too. Especially Spain.\nHuman: Planning that trip must have took forever. What convinced you to do it?\nAssistant: Well I have a friend that just inherited an old yacht, and he asked if I would come along to help him out. He is much more of a sailor than I am.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Have you gone hiking anywhere lately?\nAssistant: Yeah, I've done a little bit of ice-trekking here and there. The weather isn't always friendly down here in Antarctica!\nHuman: I was thinking about you the other day when it got below zero here. I don't know how you do it!\nAssistant: Yeah, my research keeps me here but I hate the weather. It's pretty cold in Maine this time of year though. You're probably pretty tough to withstand that New England winter.\nHuman: I'm tough! If you think tough is turning up the heat, wearing two pairs of socks and never going outside in the winter.\nAssistant: I've always wanted to visit Maine. I should come up and have a lobster roll. What is your favorite thing to cook? Do you cook any local seafood or do you just eat a lot of vegan things?\nHuman: I cook it all, no food discrimination from me. When you come up, we'll have a real New England clam bake. Lobster, steamers, corn on the cob...everything!\nAssistant: That sounds incredible. Just don't make it too spicy. Are there any great spots for photography up there?\nHuman: Of course! Would you like to take some pictures of moose and bears? \nAssistant: No bears please! I was thinking more like a rocky seashore. Maybe my law firm will transfer me out of Antarctic soon and I can move closer. I think I would like your area. Maybe Boston.\nHuman: We'll take a trip to Boston when you come up. It's a great day trip and only a couple hours from my house.\nAssistant: Yes, and the weather is usually better than down here.

Instead, I have 4 German shepherds to keep me busy. \nHuman: The girls are eleven and  five, the boy is eight. It's not too hard now since they are able to help around the house. I was nervous at first about how my other three would take it, but they are all very excited! Four German Shepards have to be a handful too.

Do you have any favorite foods I can try with my pizza?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How's your employees been this week?\nAssistant: Everything has been in ship shape, we're due for inspection any day now so everybody has been in top form. I'm proud.\nHuman: That's good to hear. I bet an upcoming inspection would have everyone nervous. Anything you're worried about?\nAssistant: I've got one employee I'm worried about this inspection, unfortunately she always seems to make little mistakes.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Have you ever been to a hip-hop show?\nAssistant: No, I just listen to it. Why you wanted to be a nurse?\nHuman: I love helping people, and my mom was also a nurse. How about, what do you want to do?\nAssistant: Am a Vet. I told you already. \nHuman: Ohh my mistake, no need to be rude. It's raining here, I bet you would like it.\nAssistant: Yes, I love the smell of the soil. Why do you want to adopt a dog?\nHuman: I think its the smarter option, many dogs need homes and I would be helping out.\nAssistant: Thats so sweet of you. Do you have any favorite breeds to adopt?\nHuman: I like pitbulls, they have a bad reputation but they are sweet dogs.\nAssistant: Ohh nice, do you want a bigger one like mine.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I finally decided to go get a new job and it was at a BBQ place!\nAssistant: Wow that sounds like both of our dream job!!  Please let me know when you're working next so I can come visit you.  What dish are they known for?\nHuman: That would be cool! I'm still learning the ropes but I've made some good racks of ribs. Do you prefer wet or dry rub? I think I prefer dry.\nAssistant: I prefer dry too.  Although for me, I still need sauce on the side or its not BBQ, you know? Are they hiring at your BBQ place?  I got rid of my third job and realized I really did need a third job to save for the wedding.\nHuman: Yep that's the nice thing about dry rub is you can pick your sauce to put on it later. I can ask my boss what we have available! We just lost one of our top pit masters so I'm sure we could use some help. Are you a good cook?\nAssistant: Well...let's just say I'm still learning.  I have a lot of patience and am willing to learn, let's just say that!  Could you send me some of those BBQ youtube videos you like to watch?\nHuman: Definitely! The nice thing about BBQ is it's hard to screw up since it takes so long to cook. There's a channel called How to BBQ Right that has a ton of great videos.\nAssistant: Thank you, I'm going to check it out right now.  I always trust your youtube and netflix recommendations so thank you! I still need to check out Day Breakers after how much you raved about that one!\nHuman: It's a fun show! Full of teenage drama but told in an adult way so it's not too overly dramatic. How's the wedding planning going?\nAssistant: That sounds like a good one!! It's going really well although as I mentioned...cash is tight! But we learned that the first thing to do to cut down on the budget is to slim down the guest list.  We're thinking only about 30 people so hopefully that will help.  Other than that..I'm letting my girlfriend make most of the decisions!\nHuman: That's probably for the best. Weddings are for the wife in my opinion. Are you serving BBQ at the reception?\nAssistant: I thought about it! ", "Dialog:\nHuman: Have you given any more thought on pre-med as a major? I could share my course list with you!\nAssistant: I really do mean it! I am thinking about my future a lot and I am thinking about what path I want to take and what makes me truly happy. I am thinking of going to a community college to explore different areas. ", "Dialog:\nHuman: I tried a new tea and I'd love to tell you about it. \nAssistant: That's cool! Is it really different to Earl grey?\nHuman: It is actually pretty similar. It is a strong orange flavored tea by Bigelow. Very citrus fruit flavored like Earl grey. So delicious!  \nAssistant: I'm going to have to try it out. Do you mind if I come over and we can try it out together?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Have you always lived in the country? Did you ever try living in a big city?\nAssistant: I just do not like the hustle and bustle of the cities. I like the quiet and calm of the countryside. I am looking for a pet. Any suggestions.\nHuman: I understand that. As an introvert, the noise can really get to me, but I love the convenience of living in the city. As far as dogs are concerned, you know I'm partial to dalmatians, haha.\nAssistant: I can understand that. I know that they are a good breed. Are they difficult to handle. At my age I must be careful what I get into. By the way is your dog back.\nHuman: Well my dog is a lot to handle. I had to get some help finding him this time, but he's back. I'm actually going to hire someone to help me mange him, so he doesn't run away again.\nAssistant: That is always good to hear that you have found a solution. Have you been looking into getting a cat?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: My shower's water pressure is having problems, so I wasn't able to sing in there and relieve some stress.\nAssistant: Bummer! That is annoying. I would love to hear your rendition of some lady gaga jams.\nHuman: You sure do love that gaga! I had planned to sing some Madonna, but obviously that did not happen.\nAssistant: Did you have any food discussions since you couldn't sing?\nHuman: I did. I was talking about GMO's and how bad they are for people. What are your favorite non GMOs?\nAssistant: I love non GMO fruits and vegetables. They are healthy, tasty, and make me feel nourished.\nHuman: My brother says the same thing. He is always talking how healthy he feels after eating non GMOs.\nAssistant: Is your brother's hair red too?\nHuman: It is, but it is more of a strawberry blonde instead of the deep red of my hair.\nAssistant: I wish I had red hair. It would match nicely with my dark clothes.\nHuman: I agree. Red hair is the perfect compliment to a dark colored wardrobe.\nAssistant: What is your favorite color to wear?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I just took the dogs for a walk at a great dog park! \nAssistant: That sounds like fun! How was it?\nHuman: It was a great dog park. George almost yanked my arm off to get in there! Hank was much better behaved!\nAssistant: Haha, George sounds like quite the energetic guy! What kind of dog is he?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How was your game tonight?  Did the music get you all pumped up?\nAssistant: Honestly, not so good. I ended up tearing my ACL and now I'm out for the rest of the season! I've been bummed about it all day. Our team ended up winning the game though, so I have mixed emotions about it. \nHuman: Oh no! Man, I'm so sorry to hear that. Isn't there anything they can do to fix it? It's only the middle of the season.\nAssistant: Unfortunately no. Just a bunch of rest and physical therapy. You know how much basketball means to me, I'm trying to be strong but it's hard. What's even worse is that I'm supposed to give a motivational speech tomorrow and I'm scared I'm not going to do well. What would you do if you were in my situation?\nHuman: Aw man, that's tough. Can you postpone it? It doesn't really sound like the best time. Of course, you could turn it around to say that sometimes things get tough and you have to work hard and persevere and be patient. I mean, one good thing about this is you can focus more on your speaking career. \nAssistant: You're right, I guess I could choose either option. I feel very privileged, you know? I have a ton of money and can afford to take care of myself. It makes me feel bad for being sad about my injury. If you have free time tomorrow, I would really love if you came to the speech tomorrow for some support. We can go grab some food and drinks after, on me! \nHuman: Of course. I'd be honored. Money has nothing to do with it. When something bad happens, you feel it whether you're rich or poor. I'd be happy to come over early and listen to you practice if you think that'd help. We could play some music and get you all pumped up. lol\nAssistant: That's so right, man you really are the best person to go to when I'm feeling down. I would love getting in some extra practice! This might sound cheesy, but I got 2pac's greatest hits on vinyl and a new record player, I've been listening to it non stop. I've been meaning to show you!\nHuman: Let's do it! I've never heard 2pac on vinyl. I bet it sounds so much better than digital. What time should I come over?\nAssistant: It really does, it sounds way smoother and more authentic. If that makes sense? If you're able to swing by after my doctor's appointment around 10am that would be great. We don't have to be there until 2:30, so it'll give us a good amount of time for practice. My maid will be over as well so she can whip us up a really good breakfast. Do you have any requests? She can cook just about anything!\nHuman: That sounds great. I'm so jealous you have a maid. What about French Toast. My mom makes terrible French Toast, but I love it. You want me to bring anything with me?\nAssistant: I think French Toast would be a perfect breakfast, I was thinking of having my maid whip up a batch of eggs benedict, but that works too. No I'm sorry you have to bring yourself over, that's one thing I'm terrible at. I'm just really excited to get music going again, I can't wait. To make a book cover.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How was your shift at the hospital?\nAssistant: It was really exhausting, I'm glad it's over! I had a patient that was trying to argue with me about my diagnoses!\nHuman: That's too bad. Do you have any more shifts this week?\nAssistant: Just one more, thankfully. How is your sister doing? Is she just as busy?\nHuman: She is busy. It seems like she has had a lot of new patients lately. How's the bike riding going?\nAssistant: It's been great! It allows me to relieve some stress after a long shift. I like to bike by the water so I can watch the speedboats. Have you been jogging lately?\nHuman: I went a few weeks ago, but got shin splints, so I am resting for a bit. Are the trails by the water busy?\nAssistant: I haven't been jogging down there yet but I heard it's pretty crowded, especially on the weekends. I typically bike during the weekdays. Do you work from home a lot or take the bus to work?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: My nephew wants to learn violin as well. Do you happen to know any good teachers or places to learn?\nAssistant: I would love to be able to help. When I first started, I picked it up myself. There are some good YouTube videos that might help him get started.\nHuman: YouTube is a great resource for so many things, but we didn't think about it for violin lessons, so we'll check that out, thanks.  Do you have a specific breed of dog in mind to adopt, or are you going to rescue from a shelter?\nAssistant: I really want to help a rescue dog in need. We have a shelter nearby that I want to go visit soon. The problem is, I will probably want to take them all home with me! How has your weight lifting been going?\nHuman: I'm working to increase my maximum lifts, but I think there is not too much more room for improvement without steroids.  I know what you mean about wanting to take all of the shelter dogs home, they're all so sad and just need someone to love them.  Do you have a favorite Indian restaurant?\nAssistant: We have a local Indian restaurant that delivers. I love the the Sri Lanka Garlic Curry they do. Just the right level of spice. Do you have to watch what you're eating for your weight training?\nHuman: I am careful with my diet, but have to eat enough to maintain all of the muscle so I eat a lot of protein.  I enjoy some spice, but I don't care for too much heat.  Is the Garlic Curry very hot?\nAssistant: Yes, it is very hot. I like the challenge. I've never felt much pain. I bet the curry must be good for building muscles! Do you like to eat curry?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I took a walk with Fifi Von Trixibelle and made sure she didn't damage her nails.\nAssistant: It's funny Bruce, especially after the accident, has no issues getting his nails done, but little Elle is a real stinker with it!\nHuman: In many respects, dogs are lucky to have the symbiotic relationship they have with humans. They get free food and can live like kings.\nAssistant: I know right!  They definitely run my household and I bet Fifi is the same way right?\nHuman: Yes, she is. It is amazing that she lets me have her nails done. I wonder what her interpretation of her nails being painted is.\nAssistant: You do wonder what is going on in their heads.  Is she a picky eater too?\nHuman: No, definitely not. When we were on our walks earlier, she ate almost every piece of scrap food on the ground we ran across. Does Ella damage his nails when they are done?\nAssistant: Elle is weird.  She usually just gives me the silent treatment when we do get her nails done. Though the way to her heart is through her stomach!\nHuman: My dog is so well behaved. I've been thinking about getting a second dog. How do you manage ensuring your two dogs develop a good relationship and are comfortable living together?\nAssistant: Bruce is so even tempered it was pretty easy, but the key is introducing your dog first.  Maybe don't pick one out until you know they appear suitable with Fifi.  Then again, most dogs figure it out it seems.\nHuman: I assumed that most of them figure it out. Maybe I'll take my dog with me when I go shopping. I wonder if different nail colors will affect how friendly the reactions are that she gets from other dogs.\nAssistant: Maybe that would be the best way to go! ", "Dialog:\nHuman: I practiced my singing some more for my talent show appearance.\nAssistant: I think it's great that you got over your panic enough to sing in front of people!  What songs do you like to sing?\nHuman: I can sing folk songs the best for some reason. And get this, I am going to audition for a show with ponies! I wonder how ponies sing :)\nAssistant: A show with ponies?!  What do the ponies do in the show?  And I bet ponies sing by snorting, haha!\nHuman: Hey you may be right! haha The ponies are only in the background, domestic ponies of course. But how cool is that. Maybe you could draw some of them if you come to the show.\nAssistant: That sounds like so much fun!  And yes, I would like to come to the show and I will bring my drawing notebook with me.  The show is Friday, right?  What time?\nHuman: The show runs Friday and Saturday. I will have to check but I think it starts at 5:00 pm each night. So are your braces still bothering you?\nAssistant: I'll see if my mom can take me Friday.  Can't wait!  My braces mostly hurt after the orthodontist tightens them.  At least I can pick out a different color each time.\nHuman: I feel for you! But I can't wait to see you when the braces finally come off, you will look great! What's the next color you're going to pick? I vote for light blue.\nAssistant: Thanks!  I have light blue ones now so I think I'll get green next time.\nHuman: That works too since your eyes are bluish green. I must admit I am getting a little nervous about the show, expected I guess.\nAssistant: Well, I can't blame you, but I bet you will do great!

I'm actually going to hire someone to help me mange him, so he doesn't run away again.\nAssistant: I just cannot handle that. Is there a smaller manegable dog that you can suggest, or should I think of a cat. Glad your dog is back.\nHuman: I don't think it's every dalmatian, mine has just gotten feistier with age, ha. But cats are lovely too. I had a tabby before I got my dog 12 years ago. She was the sweetest and very low maintenance.  \nAssistant: I am going to do something for my new pet. Do you know of any dog groomers in the area. I have seen some around but I have no idea if they are good.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Have you always lived in the country? Did you ever try living in a big city?\nAssistant: Yes I have always lived in the country, it's so peaceful here. I don't think I could ever live in a big city.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How is your pit bull doing?\nAssistant: Thanks for asking, Bruce (my pit bull's name) is doing pretty well. He's being doing some physical therapy as his injury has made it difficult to walk, but it seems to be getting easier. \nHuman: I am so happy to hear that about Bruce.  Again I am so sorry about what happened to him.  How are you doing?\nAssistant: I'm not going to lie, it's been rough, but I'm doing a lot better now that he's able to walk again. It was so hard to see him struggle, he's normally such an active guy. I'm just thankful that my chihuahaua, Elle, wasn't injured too. How's Fifi Von Trixibelle doing?\nHuman: Oh, Fifi Von Trixibelle is a little diva.  She is doing great.  Yesterday we went get our nails done together again.  It's her birthday this weekend so I treated her to a spa day.\nAssistant: Awww I love that! Did you guys get anything done in addition to the nails? \nHuman: Just a little mani and pedi session this time. Its been awhile so it was much needed.  \nAssistant: I understand that, sometimes it's hard to make time for mani pedis! Do you have any other birthday plans for Fifi Von Trixibelle?\nHuman: We are going to go to the dog park and have a little party for her at home.  I got some balloons and ordered a cute little cake for dogs.  She is going to love it.  Do you do anything special for your doggies on their birthday?\nAssistant: Oh i love that! I usually make them some special birthday cookies (safe for dogs of course) and we'll go to the park that has a doggie splash pad. They both love the water, so always have a great time!\nHuman: Oh, that sounds like fun too.  It is so nice to do special things for them.  Especially when they bring so much joy to our lives.\nAssistant: Yes definitely! They deserve it after all the love they give us! One of my favorite ways to spend a weekend is by exploring all of the amazing restaurants and bars throughout the city. My favorite spot is The Green Lady. They make some of the best cocktails in town, and their food is absolutely delicious.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How is your Kung Fu panda?\nAssistant: I can't believe how quickly he's grown. He's almost ", "Dialog:\nHuman: Did you find any UK food at the store?\nAssistant: I only went to one store today, but I luckily was able to find some of the ingredients I need to make sticky toffee pudding.  I may try another store later on.  \nHuman: I hate it when I can't find what I need at the store. I hope you find what you need. I picked up some Cadbury MiniEggs at the store a few days ago. Yum!\nAssistant: I love Cadbury MiniEggs! This is part of the reason why I get so excited for Easter...all the Cadbury goodies start coming out!  Does your grandson like Cadbury eggs too?\nHuman: Yes. He is so kind as to help me eat them. :) He will eat anything chocolate and is not picky like I am. Honestly, I can only eat one before they get too sweet. But, it helps keep me from eating too much.\nAssistant: I'm trying to cut back on my sugar intake as well.

How is your work going?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Are you able to go to the zoo this weekend?\nAssistant: Yes, I try to go basically every weekend haha. Are you working?\nHuman: That's good you should go to my job lol. Not today but I do go in tomorrow. How about yourself?\nAssistant: Well the bakery has been very busy lately, almost don't have enough time to garden!\nHuman: That's a shame. How have your plants been anyway mine are just starting to come in for the season.\nAssistant: Oh same here! Isn't it wonderful to watch them grow a bit every day?\nHuman: Yeah I got some joy out of it, that's why I still do it lol. So what are your plans this weekend?\nAssistant: Well I'm going to the zoo to take some pics of the animals. you?\nHuman: Great you'll have to send me some. I think I'm working this weekend. I have to clean up a bunch of cages and perform basic maintenance. \nAssistant: What's your favorite animal at the zoo?\nHuman: Definitely the tigers and lions.

Do you like to watch religious programs too?\nHuman: I actually do enjoy religious programs.  I find it more enjoyable than Netflix! What kind of game shows do you watch?\nAssistant: I like game shows and quiz shows myself. What type of religious programs do you watch? Are you religious? If so, what is the religion you follow?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: Have you ever been to a hip-hop show?\nAssistant: No, I just listen to it.

Are you fond of cats? \nAssistant: Not really, they aren't cuddly enough for me.\nHuman: That's true! Dogs are the most cutest actually. Are you still a nurse as you had mentioned to me? \nAssistant: Yes, and I work nights and weekends usually.\nHuman: That must be tough. I can't imagine working at night and weekends! I work as a national guard and sometimes, but very rarely I do have to work on the weekends. I literally don't like that. Its so difficult working during the weekends. \nAssistant: I'm kinda used to it now. I am able to enjoy warm summer afternoons before I go to work.\nHuman: Yes, I can imagine that. I used to work in the medical field previously before working as a national guard, and you're usually working at nights and weekends. So, eventually you get used to the routine. Well, I am glad you enjoy summer afternoons, because I love winter, and really enjoy the weather! \nAssistant: Has your guard unit ever been deployed?\nHuman: No, it will soon be deployed. Its a really tough job though. What do you think?\nAssistant: I'd imagine so. I've had to go on deployment before, it was really difficult.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: My favorite style is anything gold. Do you have a favorite style?\nAssistant: I just like simple styles.  What do you usually draw?\nHuman: I mainly use a style of realism, opting to draw beautiful, intricate landscapes and portraits of others. I'm hoping to sell some of my drawings and paintings soon to supplement my income.\nAssistant: That sounds very cool!  You can use that supplemental income to buy all the pizzas and earrings you want.\nHuman: Hahaha yes that is true. I can only eat so many pizzas, though, but my appetite for earrings and fashion is insatiable!\nAssistant: Haha! ", "Dialog:\nHuman: I did some quick research about Japan, sounds like an amazing place!\nAssistant: It is. I think it is a place that everyone should visit at least once. But then I do think that about most places. What did you find out about Japan? Maybe you could come with?\nHuman: I looked into the Meiji Jingu shrine that you talked about and it is beautiful! When are you going to the wellness festival?\nAssistant: It is truly beautiful. The Shichi-Go-San festival is in November so I have a while to wait but I just can't wait!\nHuman: Maybe I will be able to go then since it is in November. That would be a lot of fun! \nAssistant: Yes and there is so much to do in Autumn; ikugi-en Gardens, Icho Namiki, Meditation trip to Bhutan, Mount Takao and Kamakura. We'll need 10 days, at least. I really hope you can come and explore with me. \nHuman: I hope so too! Is anyone else going with you?\nAssistant: At the moment I'm just in the planning stage. I though about asking my cousin but I haven't yet. Or may be we could both invite someone and make it four? Could be even more fun. It is expensive though so have taken on a bit of extra work tutoring to save up.  \nHuman: Having more people go could make it more affordable depending on where we stay. I will see if I can find a fourth. Are you still living with your parents?\nAssistant: Yes. Can't afford to move out just yet and I definately wouldn't be able to travel to Japan. It can be a pain but I love them really. They are generally pretty good about letting me have some privacy. What about you? How is life and hockey? \nHuman: Life is good, I have been very busy and haven't had time for hockey. Do you watch with your dad?\nAssistant: Oh no! I don't watch it with him. I couldn't bear it.

Have you read that one yet?\nAssistant: No I have not. What is it about? It sounds pretty interesting. Is it crime related?\nHuman: Yes, it's crime related, but it also explores family dynamics.

Of course. So, you live right off  the strip, huh? Well I'm there so much I practically live on the Strip. You single? I am. I mean, there are girls and there are girls, but I ain't got no girl girl right now. \nHuman: I'm casually dating atm, maybe we can hang out sometime and play some craps.  Maybe hit up a buffet too or something.  \nAssistant: Really? Like, really? Girl, imma treat you so good. You gonna be ridin with Slick D - that's what my homies call me. What you like to do?

I want to go camping under the stars sometime soon in the desert.\nAssistant: Yea, baby. I got a real nice place up in the mountains. It's real beautiful. And the stars come out. We'll go catch the sunset and watch, how about that?\nHuman: That sounds like fun, stargazing under a clear desert sky is one of my favorite things to do.  Especially when you can see the city lights in the distance.\nAssistant: Exactly, and we can catch the stars. I got a telescope. I can show you all sorts of neat stars.

I think we're great, but I hear the competition is expected to be stiff. In the music industry, that's the breaks. You have to develop a tough skin. This coming Summer we'll be at the Band Battle in Louisiana near you! I can't wait to try the food there.\nHuman: Oh you should because the gumbo here is to die for. Ever had gumbo?\nAssistant: I never had but it looks delicious.

Nature?\nAssistant: It sits along a natural spring, so I get to watch the water flow, which is really relaxing. \nHuman: That sounds wonderful! I wish I had someone to go with too, like my girlfriend. You're lucky you met yours at yoga! She has never tried yoga. Do you have any suggestions for convincing her to go with me?\nAssistant: Maybe tell her that it will help her relax. With both of you being in college I would imagine that would be pretty convincing. \nHuman: Yeah, good idea. College can be stressful! And we could spend more time together. It is hard sometimes, living with parents. Do you live on your own in a house or apartment?\nAssistant: I have a small condo right near the studio. I love living by my work! I don't have to commute every day, which is great.

I heard the venues in your area have great food and drink. \nHuman: No I haven't got my pizza yet. The ribs at this bbq place are really good here too.\nAssistant: Oh man, I haven't had ribs in such a long time. Those sound like they'd hit the spot right about now. Do you have the weekend off from work? Since I sell stuff from home my days tend to blend together lol.\nHuman: Yes, those ribs really are great. My job is very stressful sometimes I wish I worked from home.\nAssistant: I think I need to start sending you some of my extra business. Maybe you can keep your job and I'll help you out with more money so you don't have to work so hard! ", "Dialog:\nHuman: What is your dogs name?\nAssistant: He is named Rusty. He is a pitbull. What is your dog named?\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How is Sleuth doing? I know you said he was getting on in years.\nAssistant: Surprisingly well. I keep thinking he is going to slow down, but he still loves to run and play. Hopefully he sticks around a few more years. How is your cat?\nHuman: He is doing great! I had a fun experience with him the other day when a friend came by. It is the reason I gave him his name!\nAssistant: That's good to hear :) What is the story behind his name?\nHuman: Did I ever tell you his real, full name? Because if not, the story will surely make you laugh XD\nAssistant: Is Liz his full name? If not, then you haven't told me his full name. I'd love to hear it and the story. \nHuman: Well, I always wanted to get a dog named 5 miles so I could tell people that I walk 5 miles daily. But when I got the kitten, I decided that he should have a great unique name. So I named him Lizard. Liz is for short, and when people come over and I call his name out, LIZARD, and he comes running, they are like what? I enjoy messing with people.\nAssistant: Haha! That is very creative. I would like seeing the face of your friends when you do that. have you ever used Liz to model any of your art? \nHuman: I don't think anyone would want a painting of a fat lazy cat sitting in the sun lol. How is it going at the newspaper? Anything exciting to cover lately?\nAssistant: You never know :) The newspaper is always busy and there is always a new deadline. Sometimes it is hard to keep finding story ideas. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy it, but even when I do find something I'm interested in I never have enough time to go as deeply as I'd want to on it before we have to move on to the next thing. Have you found any work to supplement your art?\nHuman: I mean. It is really too embarrassing to talk about it. I am not really happy about what I am doing for money now. What beat do you have for the paper?  I always thought it would be interesting to get to like go take photos of fires and crashes and stuff.\nAssistant: It can be gruesome at times, but I guess if you like to take pictures it could be interesting. You might find it stressful though. I think its better to go to work in a park. You get to see the sunrise every morning. I know some journalists who like it, and they love to take pictures too.

No I have not had a cat unfortunately. Just my dog Sally! I really hope to own a cat soon, do they get along well with Huskies?\nAssistant: You should totally get a cat. They can be a handful, but they are also very funny. They don't get along well with a lot of dogs. They're mostly nocturnal. They don't get along well with Alaskan huskies. They really do not get along with them at all.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: My guard unit has been deployed and it was the toughest thing ever.\nAssistant: Where is your guard unit deployed?

It is really something best witnessed up close. \nHuman: Did you actually get to climb any mountains there? It must be difficult in the weather conditions!\nAssistant: No i'm too chicken to clime a mountain. I took a hiking trail though. Just as good. \nHuman: I could understand that.

When is the talent show event happening?\nHuman: Next week. We play death metal. I hope people like it! \nAssistant: I bet they sure will! Your band is very talented. Do you blog or teach music for side income?\nHuman: No, but maybe I should. I'd like to earn some money on the side so I can move out of my parents' house!\nAssistant: Yes, I suggest you try. The blogging can eventually be mainly a passive income stream Teaching music can earn you dozens of dollars an hour with your skills. Plus, it might look good on your resume when you apply for your first job out of college. When will you be graduating?\nHuman: Thanks for the advice! I think you are right. I do blog about math, which is fun but it is not earning me much money. I will graduate in two more years.\nAssistant: In the beginning, people earn next to nothing but if you keep blogging with passion, you will slowly get there (earning passive side income). I have a Youtube channel and blog about tutoring Math which earns me some passive income.\nHuman: Nice! How long have you been doing this? And you are also a teacher in real life, too?\nAssistant: I have been blogging and creating Youtube content for nearly a decade on top of my main job teaching at a middle school in New York City.

I think my work colleagues and customers would think I was even more 'loopy' than they already do!\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: I went for a nature hike and got some great pictures of bears, dear, and birds.\nAssistant: That is so neat. I am not that great at photography but I love learning new things. Do you go on a nature hikes a lot?\nHuman: When I can, I work from home so I can get out often.  What do you hunt?\nAssistant: I love hunting for deer, ducks, geese, you name I have probably hunted it. I hunt to feed my family. Have you ever been hunting before?\nHuman: I have not been.  But I do love venison.  And the fact you do it to feed your family is great.\nAssistant: Yes it is really great to eat. You said you work from home, what do you do for a living?\nHuman: I work for the times.  I help do the editing.  It's a mundane job, but I get to work from home.\nAssistant: I bet working for the times is fun though. Working from home is really nice but don't you miss being around people?\nHuman: Not really,  I enjoy being by myself.

I got rid of my third job and realized I really did need a third job to save for the wedding.\nHuman: Yep that's the nice thing about dry rub is you can pick your sauce to put on it later. I can ask my boss what we have available! We just lost one of our top pit masters so I'm sure we could use some help. Are you a good cook?\nAssistant: Well...let's just say I'm still learning.  I have a lot of patience and am willing to learn, let's just say that!  Could you send me some of those BBQ youtube videos you like to watch?\nHuman: Definitely! The nice thing about BBQ is it's hard to screw up since it takes so long to cook. There's a channel called How to BBQ Right that has a ton of great videos.\nAssistant: Thanks, I'll check it out.

I can talk to my dad and get you some special deals. Just feel free to call me and we can go from there.\nHuman: Great! I'm looking forward to that and my coworkers are too. Everyone loves Italian.

I really want to do it though.\nHuman: That's very noble of you. Are there any shelters near where you live?\nAssistant: No, that is part of the problem. I have to go and pick up the dog from the adoption shelter, and the closest one is about 3 hours away. I do not have a car, but i will do it one day. Have you been to the gym lately?\nHuman: I have a pretty nice small gym. Once I decided to get serious about the lifting, I felt it was the only option. Perhaps you could join a local facebook group and find someone to help you with transportation.\nAssistant: That is really cool. I wish i could lift as much as you can. Hey, that is a really good idea. I didn't even think about that, thank you for the great idea.\nHuman: No problem. Shoot, if you want I could swing by the next time I'm out your way and we'll go. I just worry I won't be able to leave without wanting to take them all.\nAssistant: That would be perfect, i really appreciate it.

I bet that helps you meet people.\nAssistant: We are trying to get more gigs, but our music is not the most popular genre. We play classic rock and blues.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: How was your day off? Did you get to play with your dog?\nAssistant: Very relaxing. Yes - I went hiking on a local trail with my dog in the morning. How are your children? \nHuman: That sounds nice, how was the weather?

It's so hard to loose a pet! \nHuman: I meant that I changed the color of my walls to blue. They were white before. Thanks for your condolences about my dog. Do you have a pet?\nAssistant: I don't have a pet currently but I had a cat when I was younger. Blue sounds good! It would really bring more color into the room. My home could really do with redecorating. I haven't changed it since I moved in years ago.\nHuman: You could change the color of your walls too. What color are they now, and what new color would you pick?\nAssistant: The walls are currently cream/beige. I would change them to a dark brown. It would look so dark in the room but it will be really nice when everything is in its place. I need more furniture. I just have a bed and wardrobe. I have so much money still in the bank from my job. I might actually invest in a new sofa set or a dinner table.

How is Socks doing though?\nAssistant: Socks is great, she has a vet appointment coming up soon but she doesn't play up at the vets. How has life been since you lost your mum?\nHuman: It's been a real struggle. My sister took Socks, which is great because I was terrified of watching her, but dividing up the estate has been a real challenge because mom didn't leave a will. Do you have a will set up in case you die?\nAssistant: No I haven't, my mum has.

But I understand you have to go with what the group prefers.\nHuman: Well were going to go with catering from your dad's restaurant.\nAssistant: That is great. I really appreciate that. I can talk to my dad and get you some special deals. Just feel free to call me and we can go from there.\nHuman: Great! I'm looking forward to that and my coworkers are too. Everyone loves Italian. Can we get some vegetarian and vegan options along with meat options?\nAssistant: You sure can. That should not be a problem. Are you looking for something specific in vegan stuff. Vegans can be very choosy at times.\nHuman: If there is some kind of vegetable sauce that you all can make, that would be nice. As long as they aren't stuck with just a side salad, haha.\nAssistant: Of course we can do that, but take my word that is not going to help. I suggest you talk to them and get to know what they eat and what they don't. I do not think vegetable sauce alone is going to help.\nHuman: Good idea, I'll talk with them and then see what we can do.\nAssistant: I understand. Good luck.\n", "Dialog:\nHuman: When do you plan to hike at Grand Canyon\nAssistant: I plan on doing it towards the end of next month. I am preparing myself physically and psychologically\nHuman: What kind of preparation have you had to put into it? I would love to give it a try myself but don't think I am quite there yet, maybe we can do it together some day.\nAssistant: Well, since I know the adventure requires effort and energy. I always run everyday for at least an hour and go to the gym for half an hour\nHuman: That's good, Sorry I have to expand on my previous message, I completed a hike around the Grand Canyon in a group, but I would like to complete it Solo, well, with my coffee of course! I still have a way to go from my car accident last year, every week I am feeling stronger!\nAssistant: How was it. was it gruesome. Im sorry to hear about your accident. I hope you get well soon.\nHuman: It wasn't great obviously, especially having to be bed bound for 3 months, but fortunately no long term injuries, I have slowly been building up on my hikes, the dream is to complete the Grand Canyon solo. I have great faith you will do great.\nAssistant: You must have gone through a tough time in the process. Seems like you are strongly physically and spiritually\nHuman: It was very challenging but I was very lucky too, especially to be able to continue doing what I love most, when you complete it you will feel a great sense of achievement that will stay with you forever, keep that in mind when you feel you're being pushed to your limits on the hike.\nAssistant: You are very encouraging friend. I would love to have you go with me on the hike\nHuman: You're most welcome, I would love that too, you will do great.\nAssistant: I hope you can.

Do you find your classes in politics interesting?  I guess they can't be any worse than my business classes.\nHuman: They can be boring. I like it when we do simulations role play but not the studying. How about you? What are your classes like?\nAssistant: Pretty dry. It is very difficult some days to stay engaged. I was thinking on trying classes in other majors to see if there is something more interesting.\nHuman: I like professors who are engaging. I guess some professors are dry no matter what the major. Have you heard any good new music?\nAssistant: That is true I've seen some professors that could make an improv class boring. Do you think Katy Perry will ever put out any new music?\nHuman: I haven't heard anything really new but I hope she does. Her stuff makes me happy. Have you ever seen her in concert?\nAssistant: No. I've not been lucky enough to get tickets.  They are so expensive anymore It's really hard to come up with that kind of cash. What about you. You ever see her live?\nHuman: No, I haven't. Like you, it's too expensive for a college student. Hey, I have to go study now. Take care. Talk to you soon.\nAssistant: I will.

I live in the city but I grew up in California. I get homesick a lot but I still take walks on the beach every single chance I get. In fact, I'm taking a vacation to Thailand next month and will be going to the beaches there. Have you ever been?\nAssistant: I've never been anywhere outside of the US, besides going to Canada once as a kid. I'd love to do more travel. Thailand looks so beautiful, so I'm rather envious. Is it going to be your first trip there?\nHuman: I have been once before and fell in love. I told myself I'd go back to visit the beaches since I only got a chance to go to Bangkok when I went the first time. You should definitely try to travel more, there is so much to discover!\nAssistant: I agree, but I haven't been in a financial position to do much of that. Thankfully, my wife got an amazing job, and so our situation's improving enough for us to start planning some international travel next year. We're thinking of going to Japan.\nHuman: Nice! Thailand was very, very cheap. My flight cost less than a thousand dollars round trip and I spent less than a thousand dollars while I was there and I was there for two weeks. Japan I hear is very expensive, though. I'm glad your financial situation is improving! Hopefully you get to travel a lot in a few years!\nAssistant: Thank you! Yes, Japan is pretty expensive, but we both have been wanting to visit the Disney theme park over there, because it looks so amazing. So are you doing anything else besides laying on the beach when you visit Thailand?\nHuman: I will be going to Chiang Mai to stay at an elephant sanctuary for about a week where I will be doing charity work.
