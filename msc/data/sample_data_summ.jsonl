I see your angle on it, why did you choose extra-terrestrial tech and not ours to make the commentary?  \nSpeaker 1: I wanted to underscore how foreign we as humans often are to the places our communities and industries bleed into.  Also, I felt like the UFOs would be startling and maybe thought-provoking in terms of thinking about how everything on earth, and the universe as a whole, fits together.  Also, UFOs are easy to paint.\nSpeaker 2: Deep thinker and pragmatic too, if anyone deserves to get exhibited, someone like that does.  Well done!  Anyway, what's your next piece going to be about? \nSpeaker 1: I'm going to take my dog with me on a trip to Teddy Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota.  I'm going to try to do some painting there, though I'll have to see the terrain before I know what I'd ultimately like to paint.  I've never been to North Dakota so I'm looking forward to it.\nSpeaker 2: Me neither, but the pictures I've seen look impressive.  I don't have a dog, I'm more of a cat person.  Although, I do regret not having a pet that can accompany on walks into the countryside. \nSpeaker 1: What do you think you're going to do with all your kittens?  Are you going to give them away eventually?\nSpeaker 2: That's a good question.  They are so cute it's hard to give them away, but I don't have room for so many cats.  Are you interested in having one?\nSpeaker 1: Hmm, that's a good question.  I think I'd have to pass because I couldn't bring the cat everywhere I take my dog.  But I have a few family members who might be willing if you need more taken off your hands.\nSpeaker 2: Yes please ask them.  They grow so quickly and it won't be long when they are ready to go to a new home.

After that they have their school work in front of them until completed. No other options or distractions.\nSpeaker 1: I'll send the recipe to you, no problem. Yes, those are great tips. It's just hard for me, since they are in different grades and have different amounts of homework. Sometimes I have to help one more than the other. And as the saying goes, while the cat's away ...

Insurance companies do make it difficult. They are not in the business to just give away money. If they can delay or deny a claim, then they will. Was it stressful to deal with them, even though they are a specialist company?\nSpeaker 1: It was as stressful as I expected.

Everything is within walking distance. If I need a car to go further away, then I get a ride or get an Uber. My kayaks or going jogging are my stress relievers.

Yes, mental health is more important, in my mind, (no pun intended!), than physical health. You can be in peak physical health, but if you're mind is not right, then you could spiral downwards very quickly. Just think about all those professional athletes who are in the news who get caught doing really stupid things. It's amazing. Are you seeing someone professionally about your feelings towards your ex-wife?\nSpeaker 1: I'm not, I thought about it a while back.

I'll have to add it to my to-do list and maybe it'll get sorted. \nSpeaker 2: I don't want to tell you what to do, but if you do see someone professionally, it may take only a few sessions, so not much time.

It gets the other one interested in what his brother is doing. Which makes the actual training easier. The first task I started with was if I put a treat on the floor and told them to 'leave it'. I would then tell them 'Ok' and they could get it. I then rewarded them with another treat when they were successful.\nSpeaker 1: That sounds like a great, easy start.  I'm going to try that and see how it goes.  Wish me luck.  Do your dogs like to swim? I take mine to the beach and they absoultely love it.  You're always welcome to join us!\nSpeaker 2: My little dog, Ollie, isn't afriad of anything. He will jump right in. Dexter, on the other hand, won't even walk into the water. This summer, at our lake house, we will be working with him on it. He also doesn't care for when I give him a bath..\nSpeaker 1: Oh Ollie is just a fun boy!  Maybe with time, Dexter will learn to love it too.Have you painted your nails a new color lately?\nSpeaker 2: I actually did! Plum. It's a bit dark but I think it would make for a nice color for a wedding. My best friend is getting married in a few months.\nSpeaker 1: That sounds like a beautiful color for the wedding.  I'm sure it'll be a blast.  Let me know if you need anyone to watch the dogs if it's out of town! Maybe your dogs can teach mine a lesson or two.\nSpeaker 2: That's so sweet! That would be a huge help. In exchange, you could send your puppies over, and I can see if I can work with them so they get a little more behaved. \nSpeaker 1: I love that idea! Before you know it, we may be able to enjoy some hiking with all of you.  What a crew we will have.\nSpeaker 2: Sounds like an amazing adventure.

Is it hard to go out to eat at public places when you are so famous in the racing world? \nSpeaker 1: Lobster sound delicious! Going out to eat isn't too bad. People are very respectful when I'm out with my family. We just tried a local Korean restaurant. I'd never tried it before but it was delicious!\nSpeaker 2: Korean sounds great too! I'm up for trying any new places, as long as they are high quality. That usually means expensive.  Remind me, what college did you go to?  I went to Harvard.\nSpeaker 1: I was surprised, even my picky kids liked it. I actually didn't go to college. Since my family is racing family, I went straight to the track as soon as I could. \nSpeaker 2: Oh that makes sense.  Have you discovered any new board games with your family?\nSpeaker 1: Yes! The girls have been obsessed with Candy Land lately, and I dug my old Mousetrap game out of the attic the other day and they've been loving it.

What kind of writing do you like to do in your free time?\nSpeaker 2: Well the current story I have in the works is about a young girl dreaming of being a writer, but not a creative writer, a writer of History. She wants to use her ability of telepathy to create harmony among Earth's leading nations. So I guess you could say Fantasy/Sci-Fi. How does it sound so far?\nSpeaker 1: Oh that sounds awesome. I have a friend who's really into sci-fi so I'll have to put you in touch. You could publish it in Spanish, too.\nSpeaker 2: I'm making the conscious effort for it to be ONLY in Spanish, the proceeds will be donated to financially struggling latin groups.

It's good to have goals to meet, even if only for yourself.\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, my current goal with writing is at least one chapter per week. At this rate I'll have it done in 3 years, it's a large book.\nSpeaker 1: That doesn't seem too crazy. Heck, how long has George R R Martin taken?

What have you been practicing on your guitar?\nSpeaker 1: Right now I have only been practicing the basics since I really want to learn. I am hoping getting together we can give me the extra practice and attention I may need.\nSpeaker 2: Yea, for sure. I could teach you some Ween songs too. I know quiet a few and so does the band. The most popular one we play is \"Spinal Meningitis (Got Me Down)\". Its a real banger that gets the crowd going at shows. If you haven't listened to it yet, I highly recommend checking it out.

Hopefully you can share some of her secretes. \nSpeaker 2: Yea for sure. By the way, what is your favorite Ween Album? I personally prefer Chcolate and Cheese over The Mollusk. I know a lot of people like The Mollusk because of success of the song Ocean Man after it became a meme. I really think Chocolate and Cheese is their magnum opus though. \nSpeaker 1: How could you think that? I think the Mollusk is their best album by far. Which songs off the Chocolate and Cheese album do you prefer? I feel like the meme just allowed it to reach a larger crowd.\nSpeaker 2: That is a fair judgement. I prefer the Chocolate and Cheese because I feel like each song on the album is solid. Obviously I like their song Spinal Meningitis but then there is Voodoo Lady and I can't put my finger on it that are also great songs. Either way, both albums are good.  \nSpeaker 1: I do agree. We all have the right to our own opinion. Maybe next time we can try to show each other the songs we like best and try to convince each other which one is better.

He doesn't really get a long with other dogs or animals. I had a friend of mine bring their dog over and mine spent the whole time growling. I actually had to put him away because he was being bad.\nSpeaker 1: That sounds chaotic. This is why I don't have pets or children. I wouldn't be able to handle that behavior, but I do enjoy being a teacher. It's like having babysitting pets for a few hours.\nSpeaker 2: I think you would make a great teacher to be honest. Also I can understand that completely. Kids especially can be a handful but I wouldn't trade mine for anything. I love them to pieces. The dog does get along with them. So you are saying you wouldn't ever get a pet? What about some fish in an aquarium or a bird?\nSpeaker 1: Hm, maybe when I get older, but at the moment, I'm good on both pets and children. Being a teacher, well I guess tutor but that's the same thing, has really opened my eyes on how chaotic that is. I've seen furniture destroyed by animals. Birds are loud and destroy things. And fish tanks are expensive to keep maintained. I'm fine with just putting googlie eyes on a rock and calling it a day. Plus, I'm trying to save up for college. I wouldn't be able to take a pet with me when I go, why bother getting attached now?\nSpeaker 2: I completely understand that. It's good that you are thinking things through. I was more curious as to if it was specifically dogs or cats that you didn't like. Different strokes for different folks. My dog doesn't destroy anything as I taught him when he was young. He destroyed one thing and I punished him for it. Now he knows better.\nSpeaker 1: I would feel awful for punishing a pet though because they are just simple creatures. I wouldn't have the heart for it. Maybe it's because I'm just in high school and I haven't gotten a backbone yet. It just makes me scared for the future, what if I was too strong and wounded the animal?\nSpeaker 2: When I say punish I don't mean physically. I scolded him and took his favorite toy away. I would never lay my hands on animal in that manner. I apologize I was not clear on that.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I get it. Same thing my parents do when I'm past curfew. They take my phone away. I didn't know that could work on animals. Don't animals think differently than humans. How could a dog have a favorite toy or understand a scolding?\nSpeaker 2: They are fairly perceptive creatures. Taking away the toy is not enough alone. Scolding him and telling him over and over he's a bad dog or saying \"No\" can help them to understand. Usually it takes more than one time but he learned fairly quickly. Animals have different personalities like people. Some learn to behave well or naturally are sweet animals. Then some are just harder to deal with. My dog is fine as long as no other pets are around.\nSpeaker 1: That's actually really rad. My friend has a dog, but he just seems like a lovable idiot. I didn't know animals could have personalities. So your dog is anti-social then since you said it doesn't like other animals? Does it like other people, atleast? \nSpeaker 2: He's fine with the girls. He's actually a bit shy around other people too. It's just animals that he does not like really.

Did you find it useful?\nSpeaker 1: oh yeah!  I think some of your techniques I will use, and I think they will help me feel more confident!  Do you suggest I moisturize my skin before bed or in the morning?\nSpeaker 2: It depends on your skin type but generally I would recommend before bed. I am so glad it makes you feel more confident. Hopefully it can help you become more satisfied with everyday life. When was the last time you made a painting?\nSpeaker 1: It has been a while.  TBH I have just had a hard time this past month.  I just want to lay in bed like a bear hibernating all winter.  I want to paint, I just cant seem to get over my daily life to get that ambition.  \nSpeaker 2: I totally understand that. I find sometimes the hardest part to get motivation is to just take the first step in the right direction. If you view more of my makeup tutorials maybe you will find something that will work amazing for you and give you your confidence back. I know painting supplies can be expensive, just like makeup supplies. If you were a clown you could use paint as makeup and save money. Have you ever done face painting?\nSpeaker 1: Ha! that's great.  No I have not done face painting.  Much of my art work is oil paint.  I like to create works with a lot of texture.  However, face painting could be rewarding.  I love seeing kids with their faces painted like tigers and bears... like the whole face, not just a college symbol or a heart on their cheek.  Do you ever do makeup for men?  I wish it was more popular.\nSpeaker 2: Yes in my beauty classes we spent a few days learning about the different techniques for mens makeup. I enjoyed it but don't think there is enough money in the men's makeup industry it to make it worthwhile focusing on, but you never know! That is so cool, i've never used oil paints. Are there lots of mens makeup videos such as tutorials on Youtube? \nSpeaker 1: You know, I don't know.  I was in New York with my friend Christine... she wanted to go to a makeup convention where they did makeup for special effects as well as for regular makeup.  And I asked her if she could do my makeup, but she only ever knew how to make me look girly.  Your techniques you posted can be used by a man, so I liked that!  I should check out youtube and see what they have.  I am just scared that instead of smoothing out my skin, it will make me look like I am getting ready for a drag show.\nSpeaker 2: Hahaha yes I supposed that is possible, especially if you used too much makeup. That is a cool makeup industry (special effects). Imagine being able to do the makeup for a zombie based tv show like the walking dead! Did you enjoy New York?\nSpeaker 1: Oh yeah... I loved it.  had never been there before.  One interesting thing that happened was I left the hotel one day on the way to Ground Zero, and I walked past this old fire station.  I looked at it and thought \"This place looks familiar\"  Then this family came by and their little boy was in a Ghostbusters jumpsuit... and it dawned on me.  This was the firestation from Ghostbusters.  Anyway I talked to the family, they were on their way to the library after getting photos at the fire station.  So I asked if their little boy and I could have a picture together.  And, now I have a picture with a future ghostbuster.\nSpeaker 2: Great, I know a lot of the biggest makeup brands come from new york. Thats a cool picture!

Oh wow a bearded dragon! That's an unusual pet. What was its name? What did it eat? \nSpeaker 1: Her name was Sweet Pea. My brother named her and it just kind of stuck with all of us, so we decided to keep the name. Bearded dragons eat some vegetables and they also eat roaches and crickets. They are very interesting animals.\nSpeaker 2: That's so cool. I love her name. Was anybody in your house scared of her? My parents would be for sure. \nSpeaker 1: No one but me at first.

She probably doesn't make you sneeze like the cat does. The dogs at the shelter used to make me sneeze like crazy until I started getting monthly allergy shots. \nSpeaker 1: She for sure is. My girlfriend is the same way with dogs. How did you find out that you were allergic to them, did you have to get some kind of testing done?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it was determined in a skin-prick test. I had several skin-pricks on my back and the doctor could tell if I reacted to it. It was a little painful, but the relief I feel now was worth it. \nSpeaker 1: I will have to mention that to her because I think she has allergies to a lot of things and just does not realize it. \nSpeaker 2: Yes!

The owner actually wants me to come back twice a month to start, and we will see how it goes from there. I am pretty excited. Sorry your work has been boring. I would thing Google would be exciting all the time.\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes its quite exciting but lately not very much.  Thats great that you'll be singing twice a month!  I'm sure it will lead to big things for you, you're so talented.  Are your friends excited about it as well?\nSpeaker 1: They are happy for me. Also I can finally prove to my parents that my singing is starting to pay off. They thought I might be going in the wrong direction because there are so many singer out there. I will have to work at my regular job to make ends meet until my music career really gets going. How is the weather in Seattle? s\nSpeaker 2: Sorry I missed your question about the weather before!  Its rainy, as per usual...hows Minnesota, snowy?\nSpeaker 1: Lots of snow and lots of cold here. I can't wait until our short summer season arrives. Maybe I'll take a vacation in Florida this year, since my parents live there now.\nSpeaker 2: Oh thats a great place to get away for a week, you can sit by the pool and relax!  I would go there now to get away from the snow!\nSpeaker 1: I can't go now because of my music gig, but as soon as possible I think I will go and enjoy the great weather. There are a lot of opportunities to play outdoor tennis there also and I would really enjoy that.\nSpeaker 2: I love outdoor TEnnis, such a good way to get exercise.  Maybe you could set up a gig when you're in Florida and get some exposure there.\nSpeaker 1: It would be great to get into the music scene down there. That might give me an excuse to stay there permanently! My parents want me to move there to be close to them.

I heard that it is beautiful there\nSpeaker 2: That sounds amazing, I've always wanted to go there. You should take lots of pictures and share them.\nSpeaker 1: Sure thing. I will remember to share photos and videos. By the way how's Colorado? I would love to visit there for snowboarding in the rockies\nSpeaker 2: It's great, I love to go hiking but I am definitely curious about snowboarding. Maybe if you come visit you can teach me how.\nSpeaker 1: I like hiking too. Not in the cold weather though. I wouldn't mind hiking and camping in the summer. Maybe I will visit you in a few months time? \nSpeaker 2: I would really like that. We can go hiking and camping at one of my favorite places. It's not far from where I live. Also even during the summer, there is snow on the mountains because of the altitude.\nSpeaker 1: Oh that sounds fun. Snow in the mountain is it like glacier? That is new for me. I hope there won't be any crazy wild animals though. I am kind of scared of bob cats. I do love cats but not bob cats\nSpeaker 2: The higher you go the colder the air gets, so even during warmer weather if you go up far enough there is still snow covering the ground. I'm not sure about any bob cats, but I don't think they would be interested in us.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds very interesting. I will definitely come visit you in the summer then.

Maybe the job fair will help provide me clarity on what I want to do.\nSpeaker 2: That sounds reasonable. Have you given any more thought to how you're planning on spending the Jeopardy money?\nSpeaker 1: No, I was planning to save some and invest the rest. Do you have any suggestions?\nSpeaker 2: I don't think it would be a bad idea to look at hiring someone to edit your resume and other materials. A job consultant or someone similar might help you stand out from the crowd!\nSpeaker 1: That is an excellent idea! I will look into that.
